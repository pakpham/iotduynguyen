			This website is a part of the scientific research from 2018. The theme of project is related to the IoT-based wireless sensor nodes that used the ESP8266 and in-expensive sensors for measurring and monitoring actively the environmental parameters. All the data are stored and analyzed by graphs which provide the visual perspective of variable effects of climate change when doing the agricultural activities in Mekong Delta.
All feedbacks are welcome and please contact me directly through email:<a href="maito:nhaduy@ctu.edu.vn"><i style="color: blue">nhaduy@ctu.edu.vn</i></a>
